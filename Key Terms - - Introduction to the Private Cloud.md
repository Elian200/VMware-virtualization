### Clustering

Connecting two or more computers so that they behave (or appear to behave) like a single computer.

### Domain

A group of computers and devices on a network that are administered as a unit with rights and permissions.

### Domain Controller

A server that responds to security authentication requests in the Windows Server domain.

### Domain Name Service (DNS)

Microsoft terminology for the Domain Name System, an Internet service that translates a host name into an IP address.

### Dual-Core Processor

A CPU that includes two complete execution cores per physical processor.

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

An Internet protocol and service used to assign IP addresses dynamically to devices on a network.

### Emulated Virtual Device

A device within an emulated hardware system that is emulated by software.

### Enlightenments

A Microsoft term for implementations that reduce overhead and improve guest operating systems in virtual environments.

### Failover

The capability to switch to a redundant or standby server when the active server fails.

### Forest

A Microsoft term for a collection of domain trees that share a common schema and have implicit trust relationships.

### Group Policy

A set of rules that defines the settings and allowed actions for users and computers.

### Guests

In virtualization, an operating system being run as a virtual machine.

### Hexa-Core Processor

A CPU that includes six complete execution cores per physical processor.

### Host

In virtualization, the physical computer that supports the virtualization software.

### Hyper-V

A hypervisor-based Windows Server virtualization platform included as a role in Windows Server 2008.

### Hypervisor

A software program that manages multiple operating systems on a single computer system.

### Indirect I/O Model

A model that allows virtual machines to be independent of specific types of hardware devices used on the physical server.

### Information Pane

In Hyper-V Manager, the pane where information is provided for virtual machines and snapshots.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

A cloud computing service in which the service provider pays for servers, network equipment, storage, and backups. Customers pay only for the computing service, and they can build their own applications on the cloud.

### Integration Services

Support for components that require a secure interface between a parent partition and child partition, such as heartbeat, shutdown, and time synchronization.

### Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)

A TCP/IP-based protocol for establishing and managing connections between IP-based storage devices, hosts, and clients.

### Load Balancing

The even distribution of processing across a computer network so that no single computer is overwhelmed.

### Logical Unit Number (LUN)

A unique identifier used to designate a unit of computer storage.

### Logon Authentication

The process of identifying a user, typically based on a username and password.

### Network Address Translation (NAT)

An Internet standard that enables a LAN to use one set of IP addresses for internal traffic and a second set of addresses for external traffic.

### Network-Attached Storage (NAS)

A network appliance that is dedicated to file sharing.

### New Virtual Machine Wizard

In Hyper-V Manager, the wizard that helps users create a virtual machine.

### Organizational Unit (OU)

In Active Directory, the container that holds user and computer names and permits organization at the domain level.

### Parent Partition

The virtual machine that contains the Windows operating system after the Hyper-V role is added.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

A cloud computing service in which consumers create or acquire applications using programming languages and tools on a provider&#39;s cloud.

### Private Cloud

A cloud computing platform implemented within the corporate firewall of a private organization under the control of the IT department.

### Quad-Core Processor

A CPU that includes four complete execution cores per physical processor.

### Rapid Provisioning

The addition of virtual machines to meet increased demands for processing online requests.

### Redundancy

Duplication of server elements that provides alternatives in case of failure.

### Redundant Array Independent Disk (RAID)

An array of two or more disk drives that work together to improve fault tolerance and performance.

### Role-Based Security

A system of controlling user access to resources based on the user&#39;s role.

### Self-Service User Role

A role that grants users permission to create, operate, manage, store, and connect to their own virtual machines through the self-service portal of the System Center Virtual Machine Manager.

### Shared Disk Access

The ability of a computer to access a device or information remotely from another computer.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

A service that allows consumers to use a provider&#39;s applications running on a cloud infrastructure.

###  Standard Hardware System Environment

A consistent set of hardware provided by the virtualization program.

### Storage Area Network (SAN)

A high-speed subnetwork of shared storage devices.

### Storage Virtualization

A technology that treats storage as a single entity irrespective of the location of available physical media.

### Surveyor Pane

In Hyper-V Manager, the pane that permits the selection of a host server.

### Synthetic Virtual Devices

Virtual devices implemented in software that function only with Hyper-V.

### System Center Virtual Machine Manager

A role that enables centralized management of a virtual IT infrastructure.

### System Image

A copy of a system that contains the operating system and related files, installed applications, and configuration preferences.

### Thin Provisioning

The automated process of allocating the appropriate amount of server space at the appropriate time.

### Virtual LAN (VLAN)

A network of computers that appear to be connected to a single, logical network segment, even though they may be located on different segments of a LAN.

### Virtualization

The process of using software to simulate a physical environment and using virtual hardware on which you can install a number of operating systems (OSs) and interact with them.

### Virtualization Service Client (VSC)

A component that redirects device requests to VSPs in the parent partition via the VMBus. The process is transparent to the guest OS.

### Virtualization Service Provider (VSP)

A component that connects to the VMBus and handles device access requests from child partitions.

### Bus

A logical channel that enables communication between partitions in a Hyper-V environment.

### Windows Server Failover Clustering

Software designed to allow servers to work together as a computer cluster, which provides failover and increased availability of applications.
